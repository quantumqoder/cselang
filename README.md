CSE (acronym for **C**allable **S**equence **E**valuator) is a high-level, dynamically-typed, functional programming language, capable of implementing object-oriented features, with support for procedural programming.

The whole programming language is build around only a single syntax: `name(parameter-list) : initializer-list [=] {executable logic}`. Omitting parts of this universal syntax changes the behaviour of the construct which the compiler understands to implement the desired behavioural logic.
